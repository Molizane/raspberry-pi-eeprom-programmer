# raspberry-pi-eeprom-programmer
A simple Python script to program an EEPROM (AT28C16 or similar) with your Raspberry Pi.
This script is tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 and a ATMEL AT28C16 EEPROM on a Breadboard with 2 SN74HC595N Shift registers.

Detailed instructions how to setup with your Raspberry Pi can be found on my blog:
